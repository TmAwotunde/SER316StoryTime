So I was walking passed this Schloss, right? Then there was this beautiful Hund that looked like a Brot. The hund then crossed the Biergarten to get to the other side.
In order to make it onto the other side, I sideswiped a hideous porsche while vigorously singing along to Rammstein. So I drove my shiny BMW to the Biergarten.
